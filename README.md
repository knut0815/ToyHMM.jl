# toyHMM.jl
A simple Hidden Markov Model implementation for educational purposes

**Note:** This is just a rough implementation at the moment. I'll hopefully be developing a more flexible [HMM julia package here](https://github.com/ahwillia/HMM.jl).

### References and Acknowledgements:

This is based heavily on Michael Hamilton's python implementation:
